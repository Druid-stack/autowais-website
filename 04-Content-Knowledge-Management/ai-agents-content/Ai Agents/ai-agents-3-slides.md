# AI Agents: A 3-Slide Overview
## Understanding Agentic AI for Everyone

---

## Slide 1: What Are AI Agents? 🤖

### **Think of Them as Smart Digital Employees**

**AI Agents = Computer programs that work independently toward goals**

### Key Differences from Regular AI:
| Regular AI (ChatGPT) | AI Agents |
|---------------------|-----------|
| You ask → It answers | You give goal → It figures out how |
| Passive conversation | Active problem-solving |
| One response at a time | Multiple actions until goal achieved |

### **Simple Analogy:**
- **Regular AI** = Smart encyclopedia that answers questions
- **AI Agent** = Capable employee who handles entire projects

### **The Magic Word: AUTONOMOUS**
They can think, decide, act, and learn - all without constant human input!
