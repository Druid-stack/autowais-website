## 🚨 Issue Identified

The privacy policy link in the website footer was incorrectly pointing to the About page instead of the privacy policy page:

- **Incorrect URL**: `https://www.autowais.com/about`
- **Expected URL**: `https://www.autowais.com/privacy-policy`

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fixed Footer Component

- **File**: `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`

### Before (Incorrect)

```tsx
<Link href="/about" className="text-sm text-gray-300 hover:text-white transition-colors">
  Privacy Policy
</Link>
<Link href="/about" className="text-sm text-gray-300 hover:text-white transition-colors">
  Terms of Service
</Link>
```

### After (Correct)

```tsx
<Link href="/privacy-policy" className="text-sm text-gray-300 hover:text-white transition-colors">
  Privacy Policy
</Link>
<Link href="/terms-of-service" className="text-sm text-gray-300 hover:text-white transition-colors">
